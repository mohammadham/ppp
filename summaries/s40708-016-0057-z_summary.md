## Research Objective
The study proposes an improved diagonal queue medical image steganography technique for secure transmission of patient medical data using a combination of chaos theory (chaotic standard map), Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), and Rabin cryptosystem. This work builds upon and enhances the authors' previous technique published in 2016.

## Key Methodology

### Multi-Layer Security Architecture
The proposed algorithm operates in four main stages:

1. **Pseudo-Random Sequence Generation:**
   - Generated using LFSR and standard chaotic map
   - Secret key consists of three floating-point numbers and one integer (x₀, y₀, K, N)
   - Multiple pseudo-random sequences (L1, L2, L3, L5) generated using different primitive polynomials

2. **Permutation and XORing:**
   - Secret data is XORed with pseudo-random sequences
   - Data divided into 256-byte blocks and permuted using generated sequences

3. **Encryption using Rabin Cryptosystem:**
   - Public key cryptography applied to permuted data
   - Encrypted data divided into 16-bit blocks and further into 4-bit sub-blocks
   - Additional permutation applied to blocks and sub-blocks

4. **Steganography using Improved Diagonal Queues:**
   - Cover image divided into 8-pixel blocks
   - Each block organized into diagonal queues dynamically
   - Secret cipher text embedded in 5th to 8th LSB positions
   - Embedding positions selected using pseudo-random numbers

### Technical Components

**Chaotic Standard Map:**
- Equations: Xₙ₊₁ = Xₙ + K × sin Yₙ and Yₙ₊₁ = Yₙ + Xₙ₊₁
- Provides large key space and high sensitivity to initial conditions

**Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR):**
- Generates pseudo-random binary sequences with excellent statistical properties
- Multiple primitive polynomials used (e.g., f = 1 + x⁴ + x⁵ + x⁶ + x⁸)

**Rabin Cryptosystem:**
- Public key encryption based on integer factorization difficulty
- Provides additional cryptographic security layer

**Improved Diagonal Queue:**
- Dynamic creation (complexity: 2⁸ × 15!)
- Pixel bits distributed left-to-right or right-to-left based on random values
- Sequential embedding in eligible diagonal queues

## Key Improvements Over Previous Work
1. **Reduced Metadata Embedding:** Only secret data embedded, not metadata, freeing cover image space
2. **Enhanced Key Security:** Dynamic keys encrypted with receiver's public key instead of embedding in image
3. **Dynamic Queue Creation:** Diagonal queues created dynamically using chaos theory rather than statically

## Experimental Results

### Test Images
Brain disease medical images including:
- Vascular (Multi-Infarct) Dementia
- HIV-Associated Dementia
- Brain Huntington's Disease
- Corticobasal Degeneration

### Performance Metrics (Best Results)

**For 262 KB cover images:**
- PSNR: 75.02-77.16 dB (256 bytes payload)
- PSNR: 72.17-73.48 dB (1024 bytes payload)
- MSE: 0.0031-0.0052 (256 bytes), 0.0043-0.0067 (1024 bytes)
- Maximum embedding capacity: 34-37% of image size

**For 1048 KB cover images:**
- PSNR: 84.28-85.26 dB (256 bytes payload)
- PSNR: 79.36-80.39 dB (1024 bytes payload)
- MSE: 0.0004-0.0005 (256 bytes), 0.0021-0.0027 (1024 bytes)
- Maximum embedding capacity: 36-39% of image size

### Key Findings
- PSNR values significantly exceed the 40 dB threshold for high-quality stego images
- Histogram analysis shows negligible differences between cover and stego images
- Visual imperceptibility maintained across all test cases
- Larger cover images with smaller payloads yield optimal PSNR and MSE values

## Comparative Analysis

### Comparison with Previous Work (Jain et al. 2016):
- **PSNR improvement:** 2-3 dB higher across all test cases
- **Embedding capacity:** 3-5% increase
- **MSE:** Comparable or slightly lower

### Comparison with Other Researchers:
The proposed algorithm outperformed existing methods:
- Minimum PSNR: 72.17 dB vs. 65.53 dB (best competitor)
- Significantly better than traditional PVD methods (30-44 dB range)
- Superior visual imperceptibility and embedding capacity

## Security Analysis
1. **Seed Value Protection:** Encrypted using receiver's public key
2. **Chaos Sensitivity:** Slight changes in seed values generate completely different sequences
3. **LFSR Dependency:** LFSR seeds depend on chaotic sequences
4. **Permutation Complexity:** Multiple layers of permutation increase security
5. **Rabin Encryption:** Additional cryptographic layer with factorization-based security
6. **Overall Complexity:** 2⁸ × 15! for diagonal queue operations

The authors note that breaking the chaos-based system is "next to impossible with existing systems."

## Compliance and Application Context
- Addresses HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) requirements
- Designed for telemedicine applications requiring secure remote data transmission
- Protects patient information including: unique ID, name, disease information, doctor's remarks

## Limitations and Future Scope
- Current implementation limited to spatial domain image steganography
- Tested only with medical images
- Future work suggested for:
  - Multimedia secret data applications
  - Various image steganography domains
  - Extension to other application areas where data secrecy is critical

## Conclusion
The proposed technique successfully combines cryptography (Rabin) and steganography (improved diagonal queues) with chaos theory and LFSR to achieve:
- High security through multi-level encryption
- Excellent visual imperceptibility (PSNR > 72 dB)
- Good embedding capacity (34-39% of cover image)
- Dynamic and unpredictable embedding patterns
- Superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods

The algorithm provides a robust solution for secure medical data transmission in telemedicine environments while meeting regulatory compliance requirements.
