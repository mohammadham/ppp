## Research Objective
This paper presents a novel encryption technique that integrates Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) with the Virtual Planet Domain (VPD) approach to enhance the security of medical images, addressing the critical need for patient confidentiality and protection against unauthorized access, tampering, and adversarial attacks in telemedicine and cloud-based healthcare systems.

## Key Methodology

### Core Components

**1. DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)**
- **Purpose:** Generates synthetic decoy images used as the foundation for encryption key generation
- **Architecture:**
  - Generator: Takes 1×100 latent vector (z) from Gaussian distribution, upsamples through transposed convolutions to produce 64×64×3 RGB images
  - Discriminator: Uses strided convolutions to downsample and classify images as real or fake
  - Key improvements over classic GAN: Strided/fractional-strided convolutions, batch normalization, ReLU/Leaky ReLU activations, removal of fully connected layers
- **Training:** Adversarial training using binary cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer (α=0.0002, β₁=0.5, β₂=0.999), 100 epochs
- **Pre-training:** DCGAN trained on 10,000+ skin cancer images from Kaggle, ensuring generator is ready for immediate key generation without delays

**2. 1-DEC (1-Dimensional Exponential Chebyshev Map)**
- **Formula:** y_{n+1} = 1 - 2[cos(arccos(y_n) · e^{1/μ} · arccos(y_n))]²
- **Advantages over traditional 1D maps:**
  - Uniformly distributed outputs across entire state space
  - Positive Lyapunov Exponent (λ > 0) across wide parameter range
  - Resistant to dynamic degeneracy
  - Less computationally expensive than higher-dimensional maps
  - Easier hardware implementation for IoT devices
- **Superior chaotic behavior:** Bifurcation diagrams demonstrate consistent chaos across broader parameter ranges compared to logistic, Chebyshev, 1-DCP, and 1-DSP maps

**3. VPD (Virtual Planet Domain)**
- **Concept:** Creates 40,320 XOR rules using eight virtual planets: Uranus, Mars, Venus, Neptune, Jupiter, Earth, Saturn, Mercury
- **Implementation:** Each planet identified by unique 3-bit binary number, enabling systematic binary encoding via bitwise XOR operations
- **Used rule:** Rule-37241
- **Purpose:** Adds heightened key sensitivity and randomness, bolstering resilience against cryptographic attacks

### Key Generation Procedure

**Process:**
1. Read DCGAN-generated image; separate into R, G, B channels
2. Calculate sum of pixel values for each channel (+1 for zero-value support)
3. Concatenate sums with timestamp (DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS) and nonce
4. Apply SHA-512 hashing → 512-bit hash
5. Divide hash into 8 parts (64 bits each)
6. Convert each part to 15-digit decimal, divide by 10¹⁵
7. Use these 8 values as initial conditions for 1-DEC map
8. Generate 8 key sequences (K₁, K₂, ..., K₈) through iterative 1-DEC application

**Key Space:** 40,320 × 10¹²⁸ ≈ 2⁴⁴⁰ (vastly exceeds 2¹²⁸ security threshold)

### Encryption Algorithm

**Five-Step Process:**

**Step 1: VPD Encoding**
- Convert each RGB channel to binary bitstream
- Concatenate into single-row bitstream
- Generate sequence S₁ (every 3 consecutive bits)
- Generate sequence S₂ via cumulative XOR: S₂[i] = S₂[i-1] ⊕ S₁[i]
- Divide S₂ into 3 equal parts → reconstruct RGB channels (partial encryption)

**Step 2: 3D Pixel Intershuffling**
- Replace pixel at (i, j, k) with pixel at (K₁[i] mod 255, K₂[j] mod 255, K₃[k] mod 255)
- Highly secure and random 3D permutation

**Step 3: Zigzag XORing**
- Transform key K₄: K₄' = |K₄ × 10¹⁵| mod 256
- Apply bitwise XOR between each pixel and K₄'

**Step 4: Repeat Rounds**
- Repeat Step 1
- Repeat Step 2 with keys K₅, K₆, K₇
- Repeat Step 3 with key K₄

**Step 5: Planet XORing with K₈**
- Calculate real-time distances from Sun to 8 planets
- Arrange in ascending order, assign binary values 000-111
- Convert image pixels to 8-bit binary
- Take triplets of bits, map to planet names
- XOR with corresponding bits from scaled K₈
- Reconstruct RGB channels → final encrypted image
